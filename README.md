A static webpage that make use of GSAP and CSS3 for interactive animation.


Component Breakdown & Reusability:-

To make the development process more efficient, I broke down the webpage into reusable React components.

Steps I Followed:-

1. Component Structure
2. Implementing GSAP Animations
3. CSS3 Animations & Transitions


Technologies Used:-
-> React.js (Component-based structure)
-> GSAP (Smooth animations & scroll effects)
-> CSS3 (Animations, transitions, and responsive design)
-> Tailwind CSS (For faster styling and layout management)
